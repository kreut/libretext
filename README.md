  <p align="center">
   Adapt is the online free homework system associated with <a href="https://libretexts.org/">Libretexts</a>. By interfacing with various open technologies such as webwork, h5p, and imathas, Adapt currently has access to over 100,000 questions that can be used in assignments.  Built as a mini-LMS, instructors can create courses and assignments, add questions to the assignments, and Adapt will save the results to its gradebook.  In addition, using LTI Advantage, Adapt can pass grades back to your school's LMS if you prefer to use its gradebook infrastructure.
