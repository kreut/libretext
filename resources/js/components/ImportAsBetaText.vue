    The course you are importing has been designated as an Alpha course. If you import the course as
    a Beta course, then the two courses will be tethered. This means that new assignments and associated
    assessments in the Alpha course will
    automatically be created in the Beta course.
    <br><br><span>While you will be able to add/remove custom assignments in your
    Beta course, you will not
    be able to update/remove assignments that were created in the Alpha course.</span>
